You may build directly from Git or use a distribution tarball.
If you build from Git, make sure you have Autoconf and Automake
installed, and run:

	autoreconf -i

Afterward, or if you are starting from a distribution tarball,
run:

	./configure
	make

To install the executables, run as superuser:

	make install
